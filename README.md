# Image-Classifer
This image classifier was a part of the AI with Programming Nanodegree for Udacity (2019). 

The project is split into two independent parts with the following objectives;
- Learn about training a neural network
- Improve programming skills

The first part of the project was to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using transfer learning. 

The dataset included 102 flower categories. 

The project included the following steps:

1. Load an preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on training dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict the image content


The second part of the project is to create a command line application to predict images based on a trained model. The original model was trained on dog images, again using transfer learning, and then tasked with predicting if an inputted image was a dog and if it was a dog, what breed.
